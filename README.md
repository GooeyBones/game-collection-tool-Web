# game-collection-tool-Web
A game collection tool I'm working on for my final project in my Web Development class through GRCC. Uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This tool allows a user to add from a pre-defined list of consoles (or name a custom one if they choose!). If they decide to pick a pre-defined console, that console will be added to their console list within the middle column of the screen. From there, they can select that console to add games to, or add more consoles. If the user opts to add a custom console, it will be added to the same list, but with a generic placeholder image. When a console is clicked on, that console's games will be retrieved and added to the games list within the right-most column.
